# Next.js 15 Missing Return Statement Bug

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug that can occur in Next.js 15 applications.  If a page component (e.g., `pages/about.js`) is missing a `return` statement, Next.js may throw an error, which is sometimes difficult to understand.  The error message might not directly indicate the missing `return` statement as the root cause.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run dev`.
4. Navigate to `/about`.

You should see an error in the browser's developer console.  The `about.js` file is missing the `return` statement, which is the cause of this issue. 

## Solution

The solution is simply to add a `return` statement to the `about.js` component, even if it's just returning `null`.
